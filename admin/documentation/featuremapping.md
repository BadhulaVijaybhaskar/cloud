## **Strategic Differentiators**

1. **AI-native operations:** every console screen has an AI companion for optimization, monitoring, or generation.
2. **Multi-engine flexibility:** runs local (SQLite/DuckDB) and cloud (Postgres/Vector) seamlessly.
3. **Orchestration over functions:** LangGraph replaces function triggers with full flow control.
4. **Continuous learning system:** user feedback feeds into analytics and model fine-tuning.
5. **Enterprise-grade infra:** per-tenant isolation, secrets vault, IaC-based deploy.
