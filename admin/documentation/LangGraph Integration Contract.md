## **LangGraph Integration Contract — System View**

### 1. **Invocation Interfaces**

| Interface                       | Used by                   | Description                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **REST / gRPC API**             | API Gateway, Console, CLI | Create, run, list, and inspect jobs or workflows. |
| **Event Queue (NATS / Redis)**  | Realtime layer, triggers  | Async job submissions and status notifications.   |
| **SDK bindings (JS/Python/Go)** | Developers                | Submit workflows directly from code or pipelines. |
| **CLI**                         | DevOps, CI/CD             | Deploy graphs, manage runs, debug failures.       |

### 2. **Internal Connections**

```
API Gateway
   ↓
 LangGraph Orchestrator
   ↳ Reads policies from MCP
   ↳ Fetches secrets from Vault
   ↳ Stores run state in Postgres
   ↳ Pushes metrics to Observability
   ↳ Sends outputs to VectorDB / Object Store / Webhook
```

### Key Dependencies

* **Vault / MCP:** for secure secret injection and policy context.
* **Data Plane:** for persistent inputs/outputs (Postgres, VectorDB).
* **Observability:** for traces, metrics, cost tracking.
* **Realtime:** for pub/sub progress updates.

---

### 3. **Developer Workflow**

1. Developer defines a YAML or JSON graph:

   ```yaml
   name: summarize-reports
   nodes:
     - id: fetch
       type: sql.query
       params: { query: "select * from reports where date > now() - interval '7 days'" }
     - id: embed
       type: ai.embed
       input: fetch.results
     - id: store
       type: vector.upsert
       input: embed.output
     - id: summarize
       type: ai.generate
       input: store.output
   edges:
     - fetch -> embed
     - embed -> store
     - store -> summarize
   ```
2. Submits to Naksha Cloud via SDK or Console.
3. LangGraph validates, creates a job plan, applies policy filters.
4. Executes nodes across workers; traces results.
5. Returns job ID, progress, and outputs to user.

---

### 4. **System Roles**

| Role                     | Responsibility                               |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **LangGraph Controller** | Parses workflows, manages DAG state.         |
| **LangGraph Worker**     | Executes node logic, isolates runtime.       |
| **LangGraph Monitor**    | Aggregates traces, reports to observability. |
| **LangGraph Scheduler**  | Manages queue, retries, autoscaling.         |

---

### 5. **Outputs**

* Structured job logs and metrics (time, cost, token usage).
* Policy-compliant execution trace.
* Return payload to API, VectorDB, or webhook.
* Optional re-ingestion into BI dashboards.

### **Flow Summary**

1. **Developer / API call** submits a job or workflow definition.
2. **Controller** parses graph, validates nodes, applies policies from **MCP**, and retrieves scoped secrets from **Vault**.
3. **Scheduler** queues job and allocates worker containers.
4. **Workers** execute nodes:

   * Fetch / read data from Postgres, VectorDB, Object Store.
   * Run AI tasks (embed, generate, classify).
   * Write results back to the Data Plane.
5. **Monitor** streams metrics, traces, and costs to Observability.
6. **Controller** updates job status and returns output to the API Gateway or triggers webhooks.

---

### **Purpose**

* Central orchestration fabric inside Naksha Cloud.
* Provides scalable, auditable execution for AI and data workflows.
* Exposes consistent SDK/API for developers and system services.
* Fully integrated with MCP (policy) and Vault (security).
