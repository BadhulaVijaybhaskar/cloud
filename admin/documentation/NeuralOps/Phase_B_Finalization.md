üî• Perfect.
You‚Äôve officially reached **the end of Phase B ‚Äî NeuralOps complete**.
At this point you‚Äôve built a full **AI-driven, self-orchestrating cloud platform** that can run autonomously once the external infra (Vault + Prometheus + S3 + Postgres + Cosign) comes online.

Now we lock this milestone with a **Phase B Finalization + Audit deliverable**, just like we did for Phase A, so your coding agent (or CI pipeline) can produce a verified bundle and tag the release.

# `/docs/Phase_B_Finalization.md` ‚Äî Agent-Ready Deliverable

```markdown
# Phase B ‚Äî NeuralOps Finalization & Audit Bundle (Agent-Ready)

**Objective:**  
Validate all six Phase B milestones (B.1 ‚Üí B.6), aggregate reports, verify UI integration, and tag the release.  
**Branch:** `prod-review/PhaseB-Finalization`  
**Duration:** 1 day automated.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Scope of Verification

| Milestone | Goal | Expected Status |
|------------|------|----------------|
| B.1 Insight Engine | Anomaly detection & signal processing | ‚úÖ PASS |
| B.2 ETL & Vectorization | Run-history ‚Üí embeddings pipeline | ‚úÖ PASS |
| B.3 Recommendation API | Playbook recommendations | ‚úÖ PASS |
| B.4 Incident Orchestrator | 4-stage workflow with audit | ‚úÖ PASS |
| B.5 BYOC Connector | External cluster agent integration | ‚úÖ PASS |
| B.6 UI & Productization | Next.js dashboard + approval UX | ‚úÖ PASS (with blocked infra) |

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Agent Tasks (ordered)

### Task 1 ‚Äî Aggregate Reports
Collect all reports:
```

reports/B.1_insight.md
reports/B.2_etl.md
reports/B.3_recommender.md
reports/B.4_orchestrator.md
reports/B.5_byoc.md
reports/B.6_ui.md

```
Combine into ‚Üí `/reports/PhaseB_Aggregated.md` and `.json`.

### Task 2 ‚Äî Infrastructure Simulation Checks
If external infra (Vault, Prometheus, S3, Postgres, Cosign) is absent, run simulations:
```

python scripts/simulate_infra.py

```
Expected output ‚Üí `/reports/PhaseB_InfraSimulation.log`.

### Task 3 ‚Äî UI Smoke Verification
```

cd ui/neuralops
npm run build || npm run dev
npm run test > ../../reports/logs/B.6_ui_smoke.log

```
Collect screenshots ‚Üí `/reports/ui_screenshots/`.

### Task 4 ‚Äî API Cross-Service Integration
Run cross-service checks (Insight ‚Üí Recommender ‚Üí Orchestrator):
```

python tests/integration/test_cross_services.py

```
Output ‚Üí `/reports/PhaseB_CrossService.md`.

### Task 5 ‚Äî Policy Audit Recap
Verify Phase A policies still hold in Phase B context:
- Cosign verification still enforced in BYOC Connector and UI.  
- Vault secrets used for Connector tokens.  
- RLS active on Postgres.  
- UI approval workflow honors safety.mode manual.

Save result ‚Üí `/reports/PhaseB_PolicyCheck.md`.

### Task 6 ‚Äî Generate Snapshot & Tag
```

python scripts/generate_phase_snapshot.py B
git tag -v v2.0.0-phaseB -f
git push origin v2.0.0-phaseB

```
Output ‚Üí `/reports/PhaseB_Snapshot.json`.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Acceptance Criteria

‚úÖ All 6 milestone reports aggregated  
‚úÖ UI build and smoke tests run (success or BLOCKED)  
‚úÖ Policy audit recap PASS (no security regressions)  
‚úÖ Snapshot JSON and tag created  
‚úÖ PR `prod-review/PhaseB-Finalization` opened and merged after approval

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Helper Files (agent may create)

```

scripts/simulate_infra.py             # mock Vault/Prometheus/S3 for tests
scripts/generate_phase_snapshot.py    # output PhaseB_Snapshot.json
tests/integration/test_cross_services.py
reports/PhaseB_Aggregated.md
reports/PhaseB_PolicyCheck.md
reports/PhaseB_Snapshot.json

```

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Next Steps (after completion)

1. Review PhaseB_Aggregated.md ‚Üí confirm all PASS/BLOCKED.  
2. Merge `prod-review/PhaseB-Finalization`.  
3. Archive Phase A and Phase B under `/releases/v2.0.0/`.  
4. Proceed to Phase C planning (Autonomous Ops / NeuralOps v2).

## Deliverables Summary

‚úÖ /docs/Phase_B_Finalization.md  
‚úÖ /scripts helpers  
‚úÖ /reports/PhaseB_* bundle  
‚úÖ Git tag `v2.0.0-phaseB`  
‚úÖ PR `prod-review/PhaseB-Finalization`
```

## ‚úÖ To Run Now

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create `/docs/Phase_B_Finalization.md` with the content above.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Commit and push to your repo.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Run your coding agent with:

```bash
run -f docs/Phase_B_Finalization.md
```

It will:
‚Ä¢ aggregate reports and logs
‚Ä¢ run simulated infra tests
‚Ä¢ produce `PhaseB_Snapshot.json`
‚Ä¢ tag and open the final Phase B PR.
