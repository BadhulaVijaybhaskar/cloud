💥 Excellent — this result confirms that your **ATOM → NeuralOps orchestration layer is fully functional**, secure, and stable.
What your agent achieved with **B.4** is a milestone milestone — this service effectively became the “brain stem” connecting the AI signal layer (Insight Engine + Recommender) to the runtime automation layer.

Here’s how to move cleanly into **B.5 – BYOC Connector** next 👇

## 🔧 What B.5 Will Deliver

The **BYOC Connector** (Bring Your Own Cluster) is the thin client that lets NeuralOps operate **on any Kubernetes cluster**, not just ATOM’s internal one.

It will:

* Register an external cluster securely (Vault-signed token)
* Stream Prometheus metrics to the Insight Engine
* Accept signed WPK triggers from the Orchestrator
* Verify signatures with cosign
* Run locally as a DaemonSet or sidecar container

## 🧾 Ready-to-Run Agent File

Save the following as:

/docs/Phase_B.5_BYOC_Connector.md
```

and then give it directly to your coding agent.

# Phase B.5 — BYOC Connector Implementation (Agent-Ready)

**Goal:**  
Implement the NeuralOps BYOC Connector — a lightweight agent that allows external Kubernetes clusters to connect securely to ATOM NeuralOps for monitoring and remote orchestration.

**Branch:** `prod-feature/B.5-byoc-connector`  
**Duration:** ≈ 3 days (automated run)

---

## 1️⃣ Architecture Overview

**Agent Location:** `/services/connector/`  
**Deployment Form:** Kubernetes DaemonSet + CLI wrapper  
**Protocol:** HTTPS + JWT auth + cosign-verified commands

### Main Responsibilities
| Component | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| Registration Service | Authenticates cluster with Vault token → NeuralOps Control Plane |
| Metrics Streamer | Pulls Prometheus metrics and pushes to Insight Engine (`/signals`) |
| Execution Handler | Receives signed WPK payloads → verifies cosign → applies via k8s API |
| Health Reporter | Periodic heartbeat → Orchestrator (`/healthz`) |

## 3️⃣ Agent Behavior

1. **Register Cluster**
   - `POST /register` to NeuralOps Control Plane (`/services/orchestrator/`).
   - Sends Vault token + cluster metadata (hostname, UID, labels).

2. **Stream Metrics**
   - Scrape local Prometheus (`:9090/api/v1/query_range`).
   - Forward to Insight Engine via `POST /signals`.

3. **Receive Commands**
   - Listen for `POST /execute` from Orchestrator.
   - Verify cosign signature.
   - Apply manifest via K8s Python client or `kubectl apply`.

4. **Health & Audit**
   - Heartbeat every 30 s (`PUT /healthz`).
   - Write audit logs locally and upload to S3 daily.

---

## 4️⃣ Security Policies

- **Vault Integration:** Vault token required for registration and secret fetch.  
- **Cosign Validation:** All incoming WPKs must be signature-verified.  
- **TLS Required:** All traffic HTTPS only.  
- **Safety Mode:** Manual by default; auto exec requires policy flag.  
- **RBAC:** Run as non-root service account.  
- **Audit:** Immutable SHA-256 logs to S3 daily.

Reference Doc: `docs/policies/byoc_security.md`

## 5️⃣ Tests & Verification

Commands:
```bash
pytest services/connector/tests -q
python services/connector/agent.py --simulate
kubectl apply -f infra/helm/connector/templates/daemonset.yaml --dry-run=client
````

Expected Results:

* Agent registers successfully (`200 OK`)
* Metrics forward periodically (confirmed in Insight Engine logs)
* Signed execution request passes cosign verification
* Audit logs written with valid SHA hash

---

## 6️⃣ Acceptance Criteria

✅ Cluster registers with NeuralOps successfully
✅ Metrics forward loop operational
✅ Signed WPK executions verified and applied
✅ Audit logs uploaded to S3 daily
✅ Policy `byoc_security.md` implemented
✅ Helm chart deploys successfully (`helm template` clean)

---

## 7️⃣ Agent Execution Instructions



## 8️⃣ Post-Run Actions

* Append results to `/reports/PhaseB_Results.md`.
* If PASS → proceed to B.6 (UI & Productization).
* If BLOCKED → record missing infra in `phaseB_prereqs.json`.
