Perfect ‚Äî yes ‚úÖ

Before starting **Phase B**, we must perform a **Phase A Policy Review**.
This ensures that all of ATOM‚Äôs security, governance, tenancy, and operational policies actually behave exactly as designed (Vault ‚Üí Cosign ‚Üí Dry-Run ‚Üí RLS ‚Üí Backup ‚Üí Audit).

Here‚Äôs your complete **agent-ready deliverable set**:

# Phase A Policy Review ‚Äî Audit & Verification (Agent-Ready)

**Objective:** Validate all Phase A security + governance policies before Phase B begins.  
**Duration:** 2‚Äì3 days (auto + agent runs)  
**Branch:** `prod-review/PhaseA-Policy-Audit`

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Scope of Review
Policies and mechanisms to verify:

| Category | Focus | Expected Behavior |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 1. Cosign Signature Integrity | Registry refuses unsigned WPKs | All uploads enforced & logged |
| 2. Vault Secret Broker | All secrets via Vault AppRole | No plaintext secrets in env |
| 3. WPK Safety Mode | Default = manual | Auto only with admin approval |
| 4. Policy Engine Dry-Run | Dry-run sim before live | Block unsafe ops |
| 5. Audit Logging | Immutable SHA-256 verified logs | Audit store append-only |
| 6. Tenancy & RLS | Tenant-isolated queries | Cross-tenant reads denied |
| 7. Backup & DR | Nightly backups + restore test | Successful checksum verify |
| 8. Observability Rules | Alerts for failures | All PrometheusRules active |
| 9. Audit Exports | ETL to NeuralOps training | JSONL present |
| 10. CI/CD Security | Cosign signing + policy gate | Unsigned images blocked |

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Agent Tasks (ordered)

### Task 3 ‚Äî RLS & Tenancy Audit

Files: `infra/sql/rls_policies.sql`, `services/auth/*`
Report: `/reports/Audit_RLS.md`

Commands:

```bash
psql "$POSTGRES_DSN" -f infra/sql/rls_policies.sql > /reports/Audit_RLS.log
python scripts/test_tenancy.py --simulate-cross-tenant > /reports/Audit_RLS.json
```

Pass: Cross-tenant query fails as expected.

---

### Task 4 ‚Äî Backup & Restore Verification

Files: `infra/backup/backup_workflow_runs.sh`, `infra/scripts/restore_from_backup.sh`
Report: `/reports/Audit_Backup_DR.md`

Commands:

```bash
bash infra/backup/backup_workflow_runs.sh /tmp/phaseA_backup.sql
bash infra/scripts/restore_from_backup.sh /tmp/phaseA_backup.sql > /reports/Audit_Restore.log
sha256sum /tmp/phaseA_backup.sql > /reports/Audit_Backup_Hash.txt
```

Pass: Restore complete + hash match.

---

### Task 5 ‚Äî Observability & Alert Validation

Files: `infra/monitoring/prometheus-rules.yaml`
Report: `/reports/Audit_Observability.md`

Commands:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9090/api/v1/rules | jq . > /reports/Audit_PromRules.json
curl -s http://localhost:9090/api/v1/alerts | jq . > /reports/Audit_ActiveAlerts.json
```

Pass: Workflow failure alert rule exists and fires when simulated.

---

### Task 6 ‚Äî Audit Log Integrity & ETL Verification

Files: `infra/audit/s3_audit_logger.py`, `services/etl/export_runs/*`
Report: `/reports/Audit_Logs_ETL.md`

Commands:

```bash
python infra/audit/s3_audit_logger.py --verify sha > /reports/Audit_LogIntegrity.log
python services/etl/export_runs/export_to_jsonl.py > /reports/Audit_ETL.log
```

Pass: All logs SHA-verified; JSONL export exists.

---

### Task 7 ‚Äî Consolidated Summary

Script: `scripts/aggregate_audit.py`

Outputs:

* `/reports/PhaseA_PolicyMatrix.json`
* `/reports/PhaseA_PolicyMatrix.md`
* `/reports/PhaseA_PolicyMatrix.csv`

Matrix columns: Policy | Implemented | Enforced | Evidence File | Pass/Fail | Notes.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Acceptance Criteria

* All policy checks ‚Üí PASS or justified BLOCKED.
* Phase A policies have signed evidence in `/reports`.
* `PhaseA_PolicyMatrix.json` uploaded and referenced in main repo.
* CI pipeline includes `audit` job that runs these tests weekly.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Agent Prompt

```
You are the ATOM coding agent. Perform Phase A Policy Review per /docs/Phase_A_Policy_Review.md.

Steps:
1. Run each task (T1‚ÄìT7) in order. 
2. Collect outputs under /reports/ as listed.
3. Summarize results into PhaseA_PolicyMatrix.md and .json.
4. Commit to branch prod-review/PhaseA-Policy-Audit and open PR.
If any policy cannot be tested (lack of Vault, Prometheus, etc.), mark BLOCKED and describe missing prereq.
Do not modify Phase B files until review completes.
```

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Post-Review Actions

1. If any policy BLOCKED ‚Üí open issue `Policy-Fix-<id>`.
2. Attach PhaseA_PolicyMatrix.md to final audit bundle.
3. After approval ‚Üí tag `v1.0.0-phaseA-audit-passed` and proceed to Phase B.

# üîß Helper Files to add
```

scripts/aggregate_audit.py          # aggregates all /reports/Audit_*.md ‚Üí matrix
infra/sql/rls_policies.sql          # actual RLS SQL if missing
scripts/test_tenancy.py             # cross-tenant check
infra/backup/backup_workflow_runs.sh
infra/scripts/restore_from_backup.sh
infra/audit/s3_audit_logger.py
services/etl/export_runs/export_to_jsonl.py

```

---

## ü™Ñ Next Action for You
1Ô∏è‚É£ Create `/docs/Phase_A_Policy_Review.md` with the content above.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Add the helper file stubs (you can leave them empty for agent to implement).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Commit and push.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Hand it to your coding agent with the prompt section already inside the .md.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Let it run overnight ‚Äî it will generate the audit matrix and mark PASS/BLOCKED for each policy.  

---

Would you like me to generate the `aggregate_audit.py` stub and `PhaseA_PolicyMatrix.json` template (next step for agent output parsing)?
