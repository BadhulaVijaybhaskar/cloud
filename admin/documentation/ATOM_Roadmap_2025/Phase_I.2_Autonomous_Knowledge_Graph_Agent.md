# Phase I.2 â€” Autonomous Knowledge Graph (Agent-Ready .md)

**Objective**  
Extend the ATOM Global Intelligence Fabric into a self-organizing, AI-driven **Knowledge Graph (KG)** connecting data, models, policies, and outcomes.  
Implements federated ontology reasoning, dynamic relationship inference, semantic lineage tracking, and continuous learning across multi-region and quantum-neural layers.

**Version:** v9.1.0-phaseI.2  
**Branch prefix (local):** `prod-feature/I.2.<task>`  
**Mode:** Autonomous execution with `SIMULATION_MODE` fallback.  

---

## Environment Variables (required)

```

POSTGRES_DSN
VAULT_ADDR
COSIGN_KEY_PATH
GLOBAL_REGISTRY_URL
MODEL_STORE_URL
POLICY_HUB_URL
NEURAL_FABRIC_URL
QUANTUM_COORD_URL
PROM_URL
SIMULATION_MODE
GRAPH_BACKEND_URL

```

If any are missing, agent must set `SIMULATION_MODE=true` and continue in mock mode.

---

## Scope & Deliverables

**Primary Goal:** Create a **distributed semantic knowledge layer** that connects:
- Data features (from I.1)
- Models (from H.2â€“H.5)
- Policies (from G.5 & H.4)
- Outcomes (scorecards, audits, optimizations)

**Deliverables**
- 6 Knowledge Graph microservices
- Graph database schema + ontology builder
- Federated reasoning engine
- Lineage tracker & explainability API
- Semantic inference router
- Integration tests & reports

## Precheck (agent-run)

```

mkdir -p reports/logs
python - <<'PY' > reports/I.2_precheck.json
import os,json
r={k:('SET' if os.getenv(k) else 'MISSING') for k in ['POSTGRES_DSN','VAULT_ADDR','COSIGN_KEY_PATH','GRAPH_BACKEND_URL']}
r['SIMULATION_MODE']=os.getenv('SIMULATION_MODE','true')
r['decision']='PROCEED' if r['POSTGRES_DSN']=='SET' else 'PROCEED_SIMULATION'
print(json.dumps(r,indent=2))
PY

```

Decision:
- `PROCEED_SIMULATION` if any critical missing.
- `PROCEED` only if DB + Vault available.

---

## Agent Execution Sequence

1. Run precheck â†’ decide SIMULATION or full.
2. Implement I.2.1 â†’ I.2.6 sequentially.
3. Run tests & verifications.
4. Generate reports, logs, and snapshot.
5. Tag version: `v9.1.0-phaseI.2`
6. Do not push or create PRs automatically.

---

## Embedded Agent Prompt

```

You are the ATOM coding agent. Execute Phase I.2 per /docs/Phase_I.2_Autonomous_Knowledge_Graph_Agent.md. Run precheck. If infra missing, set SIMULATION_MODE=true. Implement I.2.1â†’I.2.6 services, tests, and reports. Verify ontology sync, lineage tracking, and inference. Commit locally per task, generate snapshot, and tag v9.1.0-phaseI.2. Do not push remotely. Never log secrets.
