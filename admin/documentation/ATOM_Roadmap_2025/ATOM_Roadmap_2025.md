## 📘 Governance Notes

- Every phase must pass CI/CD policy checks:  
  - Signed commits (`cosign verify`)  
  - Policy learner compliance (P-1 → latest Pn)  
  - Report creation under `/reports/<phase>_summary.md`  
- All AI agents must operate under **SIMULATION_MODE=true** when external infra is unavailable.  
- Major releases require **security review sign-off** and **model verification logs**.
