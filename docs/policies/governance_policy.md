# Autonomous Ops & Governance Policy

## Overview
Policy framework for autonomous operations and AI-driven governance ensuring P1-P7 compliance with human oversight.

## Governance Principles

### Autonomous Decision Making
- **Low Risk Actions** (score < 0.4): Fully autonomous execution
- **Medium Risk Actions** (score 0.4-0.7): Autonomous with audit trail
- **High Risk Actions** (score > 0.7): Require human approval

### Action Categories
| Action Type | Risk Level | Approval Required | Audit Level |
|:------------|:-----------|:------------------|:------------|
| Scale Up/Down | Low-Medium | Auto | Standard |
| Restart Services | Medium | Auto | Enhanced |
| Key Rotation | High | Manual | Full |
| Cross-Tenant Changes | High | Manual + MFA | Full |
| Security Policy Changes | High | Manual + MFA | Full |

### Policy Compliance Matrix
- P1: All governance decisions anonymized, no PII in reasoning
- P2: All high-risk actions require cosign-signed manifests
- P3: Default to dry-run mode, require explicit approval for execution
- P4: All governance services export metrics and audit trails
- P5: Tenant isolation enforced in all autonomous actions
- P6: Decision latency < 5s, execution budget varies by action
- P7: Auto rollback on failure, circuit breaker for repeated failures

### Explainability Requirements
- Every autonomous decision must include human-readable justification
- Technical reasoning must be auditable with SHA256 hash references
- Alternative options considered must be documented
- Confidence scores and risk assessments must be provided

### Approval Workflows
- **Standard**: Email/Slack notification with 60min TTL
- **Urgent**: Multi-channel notification with 30min TTL
- **Critical**: Immediate notification with MFA requirement

## Simulation Mode
All governance actions report COMPLIANT in simulation with mock approvals and audit trails.
