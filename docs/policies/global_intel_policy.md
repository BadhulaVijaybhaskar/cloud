# Global Intelligence Fabric Policy

## Overview
Policy framework for global intelligence fabric ensuring federated learning, model exchange, and inference routing comply with P1-P7 requirements.

## Federated Learning Governance

### Feature Registration Requirements
- **Consent Mandatory**: All features require explicit tenant consent
- **Fingerprint Verification**: SHA256 fingerprints for all feature schemas
- **Anonymization**: No PII in feature catalogs or global views
- **Tenant Isolation**: Features isolated per tenant namespace

### Federated Training Controls
- **Secure Aggregation**: Privacy-preserving aggregation protocols required
- **Manifest Signing**: All training rounds require cosign-signed manifests (P2)
- **Participant Validation**: JWT-based tenant authentication (P5)
- **Audit Trail**: Immutable training logs with SHA256 references

### Model Exchange Security
- **Signature Verification**: All models must be cosign-signed before exchange
- **Content Integrity**: SHA256 checksums for all model artifacts
- **Access Control**: Download permissions based on tenant policies
- **Audit Logging**: Complete model lifecycle tracking

### Inference Routing Policy
- **Policy-Aware Routing**: Routing decisions must respect tenant policies
- **Cost Optimization**: Balance cost, latency, and performance requirements
- **Regional Compliance**: Data residency and sovereignty requirements
- **Performance SLA**: Sub-200ms routing decisions (P6)

### Policy Compliance Matrix
- P1: Feature data anonymized, no PII in global catalogs
- P2: All models and training manifests require cosign signatures
- P3: Federated training requires explicit consent and approval
- P4: All fabric services export comprehensive metrics
- P5: Tenant isolation enforced across all fabric components
- P6: Inference routing <200ms, training coordination <5s
- P7: Auto rollback on model degradation or fabric failures

### Continuous Optimization
- **Feedback Loops**: Continuous policy optimization based on fabric performance
- **Scorecard Monitoring**: Multi-dimensional fabric health tracking
- **Auto-tuning**: Safe optimizations applied automatically
- **Human Oversight**: Critical changes require manual approval

### Fairness and Bias Controls
- **Bias Detection**: Continuous monitoring for model bias and fairness
- **Demographic Parity**: Fairness metrics tracked across tenant populations
- **Drift Detection**: Model and data drift monitoring with alerts
- **Remediation**: Automated bias mitigation and model retraining

## Simulation Mode
All fabric operations report COMPLIANT in simulation with mock federated learning and model exchange.
