# Autonomous Deployment & Continuum Integration Policy

## Overview
Policy framework for autonomous deployment pipelines with quantum-neural continuum integration and production activation controls.

## Deployment Governance

### Deployment Approval Matrix
| Environment | Risk Level | Approval Required | Verification Level |
|:------------|:-----------|:------------------|:-------------------|
| Development | Low | Auto | Basic |
| Staging | Medium | Auto + Snapshot | Enhanced |
| Production | High | Manual + MFA | Full |

### Continuum Routing Policy
- **GPU Runtime**: Standard workloads, cost < $100/hour
- **Quantum Runtime**: Quantum algorithms, PQC required, cost < $500/hour  
- **Hybrid Runtime**: Mixed workloads, balanced cost/performance

### CI/CD Pipeline Requirements
- All builds must pass automated tests (P3)
- Container images must be signed with cosign (P2)
- Policy validation required before deployment
- Manifest integrity verified with SHA256 checksums

### Production Activation Controls
- **Dry-run Default**: All production activations default to dry-run mode
- **Approver Signature**: Production requires cosign-signed approval
- **Snapshot Requirement**: Pre-deployment snapshot mandatory
- **Rollback Plan**: Automated rollback on health check failure

### Policy Compliance Matrix
- P1: Deployment data anonymized, no PII in CI logs
- P2: All production manifests require cosign signatures
- P3: Dry-run default for production, explicit approval required
- P4: All deployment services export metrics and audit trails
- P5: Tenant isolation enforced in deployment pipelines
- P6: Deployment SLA < 10 minutes, continuum routing < 5s
- P7: Auto rollback on failure, circuit breaker for repeated failures

### Governance Feedback Loop
- Continuous monitoring of deployment metrics
- AI-driven policy recommendations based on performance data
- Human approval required for policy changes
- Effectiveness scoring and optimization

## Simulation Mode
All deployment actions report COMPLIANT in simulation with mock CI/CD pipelines and approval workflows.
