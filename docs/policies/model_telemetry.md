# Model Telemetry Policy

## Scope
Inference metrics and performance logs only. This policy governs the collection, storage, and retention of neural model telemetry data within ATOM Cloud Neural Fabric.

## Data Collection Limits

### Permitted Data
- Model inference latency and throughput metrics
- GPU utilization and memory consumption
- Request/response metadata (timestamps, model versions)
- Error rates and failure classifications
- Resource allocation and scaling events

### Prohibited Data
- **No PII or raw input/output stored**
- No user identifiable information in logs
- No raw model inputs or outputs
- No personal data or sensitive content

## Data Retention

- **Simulation Mode**: 7 days maximum retention
- **Production Mode**: 30 days maximum retention
- Aggregated metrics: 1 year retention for trend analysis
- All data automatically purged after retention period

## Privacy Compliance

### P1 Data Privacy Implementation
- **Strict hash anonymization** for all user-related identifiers
- Metrics must aggregate per tenant, never per individual user
- SHA256 hashing for any reference identifiers
- No correlation with personal data systems

### P4 Observability Requirements
- **Prometheus exposure only** for metrics collection
- Standardized metric labels: `tenant_id_hash`, `model_id`, `framework`
- Health endpoints must not expose sensitive data
- Metrics aggregation at service level only

## Telemetry Data Structure

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "tenant_hash": "a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "model_id": "llama-7b",
  "framework": "pytorch",
  "inference_time_ms": 150,
  "gpu_utilization": 0.75,
  "memory_usage_mb": 2048,
  "request_count": 1,
  "error_count": 0
}
```

## Enforcement

- All neural fabric services must implement this policy
- Automated compliance checks in CI/CD pipeline
- Regular audits of telemetry data collection
- Violations result in immediate service suspension

## Policy Updates

This policy is reviewed quarterly and updated as needed to maintain compliance with privacy regulations and ATOM Cloud security standards.
