# Quantum-AI Hybrid Policy

## Scope
This policy governs the operation of quantum-AI hybrid systems within ATOM Cloud, ensuring secure and compliant execution of both classical neural and quantum computing workloads.

## Hybrid Execution Rules

### P1 Data Privacy
- **No PII in quantum telemetry**: All quantum execution data must be anonymized
- **Hash-based tenant identification**: Use SHA256 hashing for tenant references
- **Input/output sanitization**: No raw quantum circuit data or results stored with PII

### P2 Secrets & Signing
- **PQC-signed job manifests**: All hybrid jobs must be signed with post-quantum signatures
- **Quantum key rotation**: Quantum execution keys rotated every 24 hours
- **Audit trail integrity**: All quantum operations logged with immutable hash chains

### P3 Execution Safety
- **Dry-run default**: All quantum circuits executed in simulation mode by default
- **Approval workflows**: Production quantum execution requires explicit approval
- **Resource limits**: Quantum jobs limited to prevent resource exhaustion

### P4 Observability
- **Quantum metrics exposure**: All quantum services expose Prometheus metrics
- **Hybrid performance tracking**: Latency and accuracy metrics for neural+quantum
- **Real-time monitoring**: Live dashboards for hybrid system health

### P5 Multi-Tenancy
- **Tenant isolation**: Quantum execution queues isolated per tenant
- **Resource quotas**: Per-tenant limits on quantum circuit complexity
- **Billing separation**: Quantum and neural resource usage tracked separately

### P6 Performance Budget
- **Neural operations**: < 1 second execution time
- **Quantum operations**: < 2 seconds execution time (simulation)
- **Hybrid operations**: < 3 seconds total execution time
- **Automatic degradation**: Fallback to neural-only if quantum unavailable

### P7 Resilience & Recovery
- **Quantum failover**: Automatic fallback to classical algorithms
- **Circuit validation**: All quantum circuits validated before execution
- **Error correction**: Quantum error mitigation strategies implemented
- **Chaos testing**: Regular resilience testing of hybrid systems

## Quantum Circuit Restrictions

### Allowed Operations
- Quantum machine learning algorithms
- Quantum optimization routines
- Quantum simulation for scientific computing
- Hybrid classical-quantum algorithms

### Prohibited Operations
- Cryptographic key generation (use dedicated PQC services)
- Unauthorized quantum advantage claims
- Resource-intensive circuits without approval
- Circuits that could compromise system stability

## Compliance Monitoring

- **Automated policy checks**: All hybrid jobs validated against policy
- **Regular audits**: Monthly review of quantum execution patterns
- **Performance monitoring**: Continuous tracking of P6 compliance
- **Security scanning**: Regular assessment of quantum attack vectors

## Emergency Procedures

### Quantum System Failure
1. Automatic fallback to neural-only execution
2. Incident logging with immutable audit trail
3. Notification to quantum operations team
4. Post-incident analysis and policy updates

### Security Breach
1. Immediate quantum system isolation
2. PQC key rotation across all services
3. Forensic analysis of quantum execution logs
4. Enhanced monitoring until threat cleared
