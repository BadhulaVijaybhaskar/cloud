# Autonomous Knowledge Graph Policy

## Overview
Policy framework for autonomous knowledge graph ensuring semantic reasoning, lineage tracking, and explainability comply with P1-P7 requirements.

## Knowledge Graph Governance

### Graph Data Management
- **Immutability**: All graph nodes and edges use SHA256 hashing for integrity
- **Tenant Isolation**: Graph data isolated per tenant namespace (P5)
- **Data Anonymization**: No PII in graph metadata or relationships (P1)
- **Audit Trail**: Complete lineage tracking with immutable audit logs

### Ontology Management
- **Signature Verification**: All ontology definitions require cosign signatures (P2)
- **Version Control**: Ontology evolution with approval workflows (P3)
- **Consistency Validation**: Automated ontology conflict detection and resolution
- **Namespace Isolation**: Tenant-specific ontology namespaces

### Semantic Reasoning Controls
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Minimum 0.8 confidence for automated inferences
- **Explainability**: All reasoning steps must be traceable and explainable
- **Human Oversight**: High-impact inferences require manual validation
- **Bias Detection**: Continuous monitoring for reasoning bias and fairness

### Lineage Tracking Requirements
- **Complete Traceability**: End-to-end lineage from data to decisions
- **Temporal Consistency**: Time-ordered lineage with event timestamps
- **Integrity Verification**: SHA256 audit hashes for all lineage events
- **Completeness Scoring**: Continuous monitoring of lineage completeness

### Integration Security
- **Source Verification**: All integrated data must have verified signatures
- **Merge Validation**: Ontology and lineage merges require validation
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automated resolution with human escalation
- **Sync Monitoring**: Real-time integration health and error tracking

### Policy Compliance Matrix
- P1: Graph data anonymized, no PII in nodes/edges/explanations
- P2: Ontologies and integration manifests require cosign signatures
- P3: Ontology evolution and high-confidence inferences require approval
- P4: All graph services export comprehensive metrics and audit logs
- P5: Tenant isolation enforced across all graph components
- P6: Query latency <500ms, reasoning operations optimized
- P7: Graph snapshots every 24h, rollback capability for all operations

### Explainability Standards
- **Human-Readable**: All explanations must be understandable by domain experts
- **Traceability**: Complete path from raw data to final insights
- **Confidence Reporting**: All inferences include confidence scores and uncertainty
- **Alternative Explanations**: Multiple interpretation paths when available

### Performance Requirements
- **Query Latency**: <500ms for standard graph queries
- **Reasoning Speed**: Semantic inference within performance budgets
- **Scalability**: Support for millions of nodes and relationships
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with automated failover

## Simulation Mode
All knowledge graph operations report COMPLIANT in simulation with mock reasoning and integration.
