# Phase C — Intelligence & Performance Finalization (Agent-Ready)

**Objective:**  
Validate all C.1–C.5 services, aggregate reports, verify policy compliance (P1–P6), and tag v3.0.0-phaseC for production deployment.  
**Branch:** `prod-review/PhaseC-Finalization`  
**Duration:** 1 day (automated)

## 1️⃣ Scope of Verification

| Task | Service | Focus | Expected Status |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| C.1 | Predictive Intelligence Engine | ML failure prediction | ✅ PASS |
| C.2 | Performance Profiler | Service profiling + budget P-6 | ✅ PASS |
| C.3 | Multi-Tenant RBAC | Tenant isolation + RLS | ✅ PASS |
| C.4 | Analytics & Reports | BI dashboards + CSV exports | ✅ PASS |
| C.5 | Model Pipeline | Automated MLOps train/deploy | ✅ PASS |

---

## 2️⃣ Agent Tasks (ordered)

### T1 — Aggregate Reports
```
python scripts/aggregate_reports.py > reports/PhaseC_Aggregated.md
```
Collect C.1–C.5 implementation reports → PhaseC_Aggregated.{md,json}.

### T2 — Infra Simulation (optional)
Run simulated checks if Vault/Prometheus/Postgres not available:
```
python scripts/simulate_infra.py > reports/PhaseC_InfraSimulation.log
```

### T3 — Cross-Service Integration Test
```
pytest tests/integration/test_cross_services.py -q
```
Produces `reports/PhaseC_CrossService.json`.

### T4 — Policy Re-Audit
Confirm P1–P6 policies hold across Phase C services.  
Write `reports/PhaseC_PolicyCheck.md`.

| Policy | Expectation |
|:--|:--|
| P-1 Data Privacy | No PII; redacted analytics |
| P-2 Secrets & Signing | Vault / Cosign integration |
| P-3 Execution Safety | Manual approval default |
| P-4 Observability | Prometheus metrics exposed |
| P-5 Multi-Tenancy | RLS + JWT tenant claims |
| P-6 Performance Budget | p95 < 800 ms enforced |

### T5 — Performance Validation
```
python scripts/perf_validator.py
```
Checks API latency & accuracy; writes `reports/PhaseC_PerfSummary.json`.

### T6 — Snapshot + Tag
```
python scripts/generate_phase_snapshot.py C
git tag -a v3.0.0-phaseC -m "Phase C Complete"
git push origin v3.0.0-phaseC
```

## 3️⃣ Acceptance Criteria

✅ All five service reports aggregated  
✅ Cross-service tests executed  
✅ Policy P1–P6 re-verified (PASS or BLOCKED noted)  
✅ Performance summary within budgets  
✅ Snapshot & tag created  
✅ PR `prod-review/PhaseC-Finalization` opened

## 4️⃣ Agent Prompt

```
You are the ATOM coding agent. Execute Phase C Finalization as per /docs/Phase_C_Finalization.md.

1. Aggregate C.1–C.5 reports → PhaseC_Aggregated.md/json.
2. Run infra simulation (if needed).
3. Run integration tests and performance validator.
4. Verify policy compliance (P1–P6).
5. Generate snapshot and tag v3.0.0-phaseC.
6. Commit reports and open PR `prod-review/PhaseC-Finalization`.
7. Timebox: 24 hours max; run unattended; mark BLOCKED only for missing infra.
```

## 5️⃣ Helper Files (for agent)

```
scripts/aggregate_reports.py        # (already exists)
scripts/simulate_infra.py           # reuse from Phase B
scripts/generate_phase_snapshot.py  # reuse from Phase B
scripts/perf_validator.py           # new below
tests/integration/test_cross_services.py
```

---

## 6️⃣ Next Steps (after completion)

1. Review PhaseC_Aggregated.md and PerfSummary.json.
2. Merge `prod-review/PhaseC-Finalization`.
3. Tag `v3.0.0-phaseC`.
4. Archive reports → `/releases/v3.0.0/PhaseC_AuditBundle.zip`.
5. Prepare for Phase D (Deep Learning and Real-Time Expansion).

## Deliverables Summary

✅ /docs/Phase_C_Finalization.md
✅ /scripts (perf + snapshot + simulation)
✅ /reports/PhaseC_* bundle
✅ Tag `v3.0.0-phaseC`
✅ PR `prod-review/PhaseC-Finalization`
