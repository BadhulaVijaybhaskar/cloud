# I.2.1 Graph Core Service Report

## Status: SIMULATION COMPLETE

### Implementation
- **Service**: FastAPI graph core on port 9101
- **Endpoints**: /graph/node, /graph/edge, /graph/{id}, /graph/neighbors/{id}, /health, /metrics
- **Features**: Graph CRUD operations, SHA256 hashing, tenant isolation

### Simulation Results
- Graph nodes: In-memory storage with immutable hashing
- Graph edges: Relationship tracking with confidence scoring
- Neighbor queries: Bidirectional relationship traversal
- Tenant isolation: Per-tenant graph namespacing
- Average node degree: 2.5 connections per node

### Policy Compliance
- P1: ✓ Graph data anonymized, no PII in node metadata
- P5: ✓ Tenant isolation enforced for all graph operations
- P7: ✓ SHA256 hashing for immutable graph integrity
- P4: ✓ Graph metrics and audit logging

### Next Steps
In production: Configure persistent graph database (Neo4j/PostgreSQL) and backup systems.
