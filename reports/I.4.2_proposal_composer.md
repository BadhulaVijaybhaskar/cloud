# I.4.2 Proposal Composer Implementation Report

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Proposal Composer service that creates signed decision manifests from inputs and neural fabric models.

## Key Features Implemented
- **Manifest Composition**: Creates structured decision manifests from context and signals
- **PII Redaction**: Automatic redaction of sensitive data unless tenant consent provided (P1)
- **Neural Fabric Integration**: Simulated AI model suggestions based on context
- **Template System**: Predefined templates for common decision patterns
- **Cosign Signing**: Simulated manifest signing for production readiness (P2)
- **Multi-channel Support**: Template-based composition for various scenarios

## Policy Compliance
- **P1 Data Privacy**: PII patterns automatically redacted from signals
- **P2 Secrets & Signing**: All manifests signed with simulated cosign signatures
- **P3 Execution Safety**: Templates include safety checks and approval requirements
- **P4 Observability**: Health and metrics endpoints exposed
- **P5 Multi-Tenancy**: JWT tenant validation on all composition requests
- **P6 Performance Budget**: Fast composition with neural fabric integration
- **P7 Resilience & Recovery**: Manifests include rollback planning

## Endpoints Implemented
- `POST /compose` - Compose decision manifest from context and signals
- `GET /templates` - List available composition templates
- `GET /health` - Service health check
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics

## Templates Available
- **cost_optimization**: For cost reduction decisions
- **security_update**: For security-related changes (high impact)
- **performance_scaling**: For performance improvements
- **emergency_response**: For urgent system responses

## PII Redaction Patterns
- Email addresses: `user@example.com` → `<REDACTED_EMAIL>`
- Phone numbers: `123-456-7890` → `<REDACTED_PHONE>`
- SSN: `123-45-6789` → `<REDACTED_SSN>`
- IP addresses: `192.168.1.1` → `<REDACTED_IP>`

## Neural Fabric Simulation
Context-based suggestions:
- "reduce cost" → scale_down actions with compute optimization
- "improve performance" → scale_up actions with enhanced instances
- "enhance security" → security group updates and WAF enablement

## Testing Results
- All unit tests pass successfully
- PII redaction working correctly
- Template application functional
- Neural fabric integration simulated
- Tenant access control enforced
- Signature generation operational

## Files Created
- `services/proposal-composer/main.py` - Main service implementation
- `services/proposal-composer/requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- `services/proposal-composer/templates.yaml` - Template definitions
- `services/proposal-composer/tests/test_composer.py` - Test suite

## Metrics Exposed
- `proposal_compositions_total` - Counter for total compositions
- `composition_processing_seconds` - Histogram for processing time

## Integration Points
- Neural Fabric URL configuration for AI model access
- Template system for standardized decision patterns
- Cosign integration for manifest signing in production
