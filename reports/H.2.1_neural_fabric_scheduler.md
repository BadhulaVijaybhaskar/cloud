# H.2.1 Neural Fabric Scheduler Implementation

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Branch**: prod-feature/H.2.1-neural-fabric-scheduler  
**Environment**: SIMULATION_MODE=true  

## Implementation
- Neural fabric job scheduling with GPU resource allocation
- Node registration and resource tracking
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Tenant-scoped job management
- Failover promotion capabilities

## Policy Compliance
- P1 Data Privacy: ✅ No sensitive data in logs
- P2 Secrets & Signing: ✅ Audit trails implemented
- P3 Execution Safety: ✅ Simulation mode active
- P4 Observability: ✅ Health/metrics endpoints
- P5 Multi-Tenancy: ✅ Tenant isolation enforced
- P6 Performance Budget: ✅ < 1s scheduling operations
- P7 Resilience: ✅ Failover capabilities implemented

## Endpoints Implemented
- POST /node/register → GPU node registration
- POST /schedule → Neural job scheduling
- GET /schedule/{job_id} → Job status retrieval
- POST /failover/promote → Failover promotion
- GET /health → Service health
- GET /metrics → Prometheus metrics

## Neural Fabric Features
- GPU resource allocation and tracking
- Multi-tenant job scheduling
- Node registration and management
- Performance metrics collection
- Failover and promotion support

## Blockers
- GPU infrastructure: BLOCKED (using simulation)
- Neural fabric runtime: BLOCKED (using simulation)
