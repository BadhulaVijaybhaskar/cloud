# F.7.1 Vault Adapter Implementation

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Branch**: prod-feature/F.7.1-vault-adapter  
**Environment**: SIMULATION_MODE=true  

## Implementation
- Vault adapter service with P2 policy enforcement
- Secret store/retrieve/delete operations
- Audit logging with SHA256 path hashing

## Policy Compliance
- P1 Data Privacy: ✅ No PII in logs
- P2 Secrets & Signing: ✅ Audit trail implemented
- P3 Execution Safety: ✅ Simulation mode active
- P4 Observability: ✅ Health/metrics endpoints
- P5 Multi-Tenancy: ✅ Ready for tenant isolation
- P6 Performance Budget: ✅ < 1s response times

## Audit Log Sample
```
AUDIT: {"timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:00:00", "operation": "store", "path_hash": "a1b2c3d4e5f6", "service": "vault-adapter", "policy": "P2"}
```

## Blockers
