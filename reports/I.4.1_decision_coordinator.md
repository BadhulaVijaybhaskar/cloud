# I.4.1 Decision Coordinator Implementation Report

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Decision Coordinator service as the central orchestrator for the federated decision fabric.

## Key Features Implemented
- **Proposal Submission**: POST /proposals endpoint with JWT tenant validation (P5)
- **Manifest Signature Validation**: Cosign signature verification simulation (P2)
- **State Snapshots**: Pre/post state SHA256 hashing for rollback capability (P7)
- **Impact Level Assessment**: High impact decisions require approver and justification (P3)
- **Async Broadcasting**: Proposals broadcast to negotiator and confidence scorer
- **Health & Metrics**: Prometheus metrics and health endpoints (P4)

## Policy Compliance
- **P1 Data Privacy**: No raw PII stored in proposals
- **P2 Secrets & Signing**: Manifest signature validation with cosign simulation
- **P3 Execution Safety**: High impact proposals require manual approver
- **P4 Observability**: Health and metrics endpoints exposed
- **P5 Multi-Tenancy**: JWT tenant claim validation on all operations
- **P6 Performance Budget**: Async processing within timeout constraints
- **P7 Resilience & Recovery**: Pre/post state snapshots with SHA256 hashes

## Endpoints Implemented
- `POST /proposals` - Submit decision proposal with tenant validation
- `GET /proposals/{id}` - Get proposal status and vote results
- `POST /proposals/{id}/enact` - Enact proposal with approver requirements
- `GET /health` - Service health check
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics

## Testing Results
- All unit tests pass successfully
- Proposal submission and retrieval working
- High impact approval requirements enforced
- Tenant isolation properly implemented
- State hash generation and validation functional

## Simulation Mode Features
- JWT token validation simulated
- Cosign signature verification simulated
- Database operations use in-memory storage
- Async broadcasting to other services simulated

## Files Created
- `services/decision-coordinator/main.py` - Main service implementation
- `services/decision-coordinator/requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- `services/decision-coordinator/Dockerfile` - Container configuration
- `services/decision-coordinator/tests/test_coordinator.py` - Test suite

## Metrics Exposed
- `decision_proposals_total` - Counter for total proposals
- `decision_enactments_total` - Counter for total enactments
- `proposal_processing_seconds` - Histogram for processing time

## Next Steps
Integration with other Phase I.4 services for complete decision fabric functionality.
