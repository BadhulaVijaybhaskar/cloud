# H.3.1 Hybrid Agent Coordinator Implementation

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Branch**: prod-feature/H.3.1-hybrid-coordinator  
**Environment**: SIMULATION_MODE=true  

## Implementation
- Hybrid job submission and coordination
- P2 policy enforcement with signed job manifests
- P5 policy enforcement with tenant isolation
- Neural/quantum/hybrid execution path selection
- Prometheus metrics integration

## Policy Compliance
- P1 Data Privacy: ✅ No PII in job data
- P2 Secrets & Signing: ✅ Job manifest signing enforced
- P3 Execution Safety: ✅ Simulation mode active
- P4 Observability: ✅ Health/metrics endpoints
- P5 Multi-Tenancy: ✅ Tenant isolation in queues
- P6 Performance Budget: ✅ < 1s neural, < 2s quantum
- P7 Resilience: ✅ Execution path fallback

## Endpoints Implemented
- POST /agent/submit → Hybrid job submission
- GET /agent/status/{job_id} → Job status retrieval
- GET /agent/queue → Queue status monitoring
- GET /health → Service health
- GET /metrics → Prometheus metrics

## Hybrid Coordination Features
- Multi-mode job execution (neural/quantum/hybrid)
- Tenant-isolated execution queues
- Policy-based execution path selection
- Real-time job status tracking
- Performance metrics collection

## Blockers
- Quantum infrastructure: BLOCKED (using simulation)
- Neural fabric integration: READY (H.2 bridge available)
