## 🔄 Integration Points

### Model Lifecycle
```python
# Create training job
job = pipeline.create_training_job("Production Model v2.1", {
    'C': 0.8, 'max_iter': 1500, 'data_size': 5000
})

# Execute training
success = pipeline.run_training_job(job.id)

# Auto-activation if performance improved
if model.accuracy > current_model.accuracy + 0.02:
    pipeline.activate_model_version(model.id)
```

### Performance Tracking
```python
# Record production performance
pipeline.record_model_performance(
    model_version_id=active_model.id,
    accuracy=0.85, precision=0.82, recall=0.88, f1=0.85,
    total_predictions=1000, correct_predictions=850
)
```

### Model Signing (P-2)
```python
# Calculate model checksum
checksum = pipeline._calculate_file_checksum(model_path)

# Sign with Vault (production) or HMAC (development)
signature = pipeline._sign_model(model_path, checksum)
```
