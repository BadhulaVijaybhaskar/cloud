- ✅ Training data pipeline (ETL with embeddings)
- ✅ Security validation (static analysis, risk scoring)
- ✅ Operational monitoring (metrics, alerts, dashboards)

### NeuralOps Implementation Path
1. **Model Training**: Use exported JSONL data for initial model training
2. **Inference Integration**: Deploy trained models for real-time decision making
3. **Feedback Loop**: Implement model performance monitoring and retraining
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Predictive failure detection and optimization recommendations

## Final Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All 10 Phase A Missing Items tasks have been successfully implemented with:
- **36 new files** created across security, observability, and operations
