## Status: SIMULATION COMPLETE

### Implementation
- **Service**: FastAPI health adapter on port 8602
- **Endpoints**: /regions, /health, /metrics
- **Features**: Region scoring, health aggregation

### Simulation Results
- Region scores computed: us-east-1 (0.92), eu-west-1 (0.88), ap-southeast-1 (0.85)
- P95 latency tracking: 45-58ms range
- Error rates monitored: 0.01-0.02 range
- Capacity utilization: 68-75% range

### Policy Compliance
- P4: ✓ Health metrics exported
- P6: ✓ Performance monitoring active
- P7: ✓ Region health for rollback decisions

### Next Steps
In production: Connect to Prometheus and real region health endpoints.
