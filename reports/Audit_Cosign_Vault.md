# Task 1 — Cosign & Vault Validation

**Objective:** Prove signature and secret integrity.

## Test Results

### Cosign Signature Enforcement
- **Status:** BLOCKED
- **Issue:** Cosign binary not found in PATH
- **Evidence:** `/reports/logs/Audit_Cosign.log`
- **Missing Dependencies:** cosign binary
- **Impact:** Cannot verify WPK signatures, security enforcement disabled

### Vault Secret Management
- **Status:** BLOCKED  
- **Issue:** VAULT_ADDR not configured
- **Evidence:** `/reports/logs/Audit_Vault.log`
- **Missing Dependencies:** VAULT_ADDR, VAULT_TOKEN or AppRole credentials
- **Impact:** Cannot retrieve secrets securely, fallback to environment variables

## Pass Criteria Assessment
- ❌ Every WPK → `verified=true` in log (BLOCKED - no cosign)
- ❌ Vault AppRole auth successful (BLOCKED - no Vault config)

## Recommendations
1. Install cosign binary: `winget install sigstore.cosign` or use container-based verification
2. Configure Vault server or implement local secret management for development
3. Set up proper signing workflow for WPK packages

## Files Tested
- `services/workflow-registry/cosign_enforcer.py` - Implementation verified
- `services/workflow-registry/vault_client.py` - Implementation verified
- Example WPK files in `examples/playbooks/` - Ready for signing

**Overall Status:** BLOCKED (Missing external dependencies)
