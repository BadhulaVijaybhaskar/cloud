## 🤖 AI Analysis Engine

### Security Pattern Detection
- **Hardcoded Secrets:** Password, API keys, tokens
- **Dangerous Functions:** eval(), exec(), os.system()
- **System Commands:** subprocess.call, shell execution
- **Code Injection:** Dynamic code execution risks

### Policy Compliance Checks
- **P-1 Data Privacy:** PII detection and anonymization
- **P-2 Secrets & Signing:** Signature validation requirements
- **P-3 Execution Safety:** Auto-execution safety controls
- **P-4 Observability:** Health/metrics endpoint validation
- **P-5 Multi-Tenancy:** JWT and tenant isolation checks
- **P-6 Performance Budget:** Performance risk detection

## 📊 Analysis Results

### Sample Analysis Output
```json
{
  "id": "analysis-uuid",
  "risk_score": 0.45,
  "violations": [
    {
      "rule": "SEC-HIGH",
      "severity": "HIGH",
      "description": "Hardcoded password detected",
      "line": 15
    },
    {
      "rule": "P-2",
      "severity": "HIGH", 
      "description": "Missing required signature"
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Remove hardcoded secrets and use environment variables",
    "Add proper cryptographic signatures using cosign"
  ],
  "approved": false
}
```

## 🎯 Risk Scoring Algorithm

### Severity Weights
- **HIGH:** 0.7 weight (Critical security issues)
- **MEDIUM:** 0.3 weight (Important compliance issues)
- **LOW:** 0.1 weight (Minor recommendations)

### Approval Criteria
- **Risk Score < 0.3:** Automatic approval eligible
- **No HIGH Violations:** Required for approval
- **Policy Compliance:** All P-series rules validated

## 🔐 Security Detection Capabilities

### Vulnerability Patterns
```python
security_patterns = [
    (r'password\s*=\s*["\'][^"\']+["\']', 'HIGH', 'Hardcoded password'),
    (r'api[_-]?key\s*=\s*["\'][^"\']+["\']', 'HIGH', 'Hardcoded API key'),
    (r'eval\s*\(', 'HIGH', 'Dangerous eval() usage'),
    (r'os\.system', 'HIGH', 'Direct system execution')
]
```

### Policy Validation Rules
- **Data Privacy:** PII pattern detection
- **Secrets Management:** Environment variable enforcement
- **Execution Safety:** Dry-run validation requirements
- **Observability:** Required endpoint validation
- **Multi-Tenancy:** JWT context validation
- **Performance:** Resource usage analysis
