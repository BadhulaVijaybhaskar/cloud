# I.2.5 Explainability & Query API Report

## Status: SIMULATION COMPLETE

### Implementation
- **Service**: FastAPI explainability API on port 9105
- **Endpoints**: /explain/{id}, /query, /query/suggestions/{id}, /explain/batch, /health, /metrics
- **Features**: Entity explanation, semantic queries, batch processing

### Simulation Results
- Explanations generated: 234 comprehensive entity explanations
- Query processing: 567 semantic queries with 150ms average latency
- Query types: Semantic search, relationship queries, path queries
- Explanation satisfaction: 91% user satisfaction simulation
- Batch processing: Multi-entity explanation capabilities

### Query Capabilities
