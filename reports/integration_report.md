## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Start Docker Desktop** to enable container runtime
2. **Install Terraform CLI** for infrastructure management
3. **Install Helm CLI** for Kubernetes deployments
4. **Configure Kubernetes cluster** (local or cloud)

### For Production Deployment
1. Set up managed Kubernetes cluster (EKS/GKE/AKS)
2. Configure external secrets management
3. Set up monitoring and alerting
4. Implement backup automation
